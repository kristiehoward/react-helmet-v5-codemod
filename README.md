# react-helmet-v5-codemod

Codemod built using jscodeshift to upgrade to v 5 of react-helmet

[React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) recently released a new version which makes the API much simpler moving forward. We are using react-helmet in over 40 different files in Docker Store, so I figured it would be best to write a codemod using jscodeshift instead of manually fixing the issues.

This is my first codemod so suggestions welcome!
